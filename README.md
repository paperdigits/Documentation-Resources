# Documentation Resources README #

Hello! Thanks for checking out my little project. 

The Documentation Resources is a project to hold resources, information, and cheat sheets that assist me in my day-to-day job as a technical writer and communicator. 

I make heavy use of emacs with org-mode, auctex for latex authoring, and nxml-mode for editing docbook. 

There is also an size conversion chart for metric-standard sizes up to one inch. 

I will continue to add to the repository as I find information worthy of keeping.

I hope someone finds this useful!
